These are such as the planned elimination of fossil fuel vehicles to be used in the industrial sector or the solar power rebates for residents in various states including WA (Australian Government 2021; Australian Government, 2024). Therefore, it is important for analysts to understand the position of Australia's current energy consumption both at state and national level. This report will outline some key points and trends that will determine Australia's future consumption based on total consumption, annual consumption, per capita consumption, and GSP growth. This could potentially help future researchers in their prediction analysis or policy analysts to determine the correct approach to regulate energy consumption.*"

        "##### **Analysis A**\n",
        "The analysis highlights a broad distribution of total energy consumption of all Australian states over the 14 years (2008-2022). It is capable of acknowledging the relationship between the size of a state's portion in the pie and the size of its total consumption in comparison to other states in Australia. The bigger portion that a state represents, the more energy it had consumed in comparison to other states in Australia, and *vice versa*. With this idea alone, analysts can determine which state contributes the most and the least to Australia's total energy consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Our Insights**\n",
        "Here, we can see that there are 4 top contributors to Australia's total energy consumption; Western Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales. This is sensible knowing how all these states are the biggest contributors to both Australia's economic and population growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Analysis B**\n",
        "The analysis covers a more in depth overview of total energy consumption distribution over the 14 years (2008-2022). Instead, it covers the individual consumption of each state, displaying each portion as each of the fuel types used in contribution towards that state's total energy consumption. Biggest portion(s) represents the main source of that state's energy. Smallest portion(s) represents the minor source of the state's energy. Considering how some data also represent renewables, this idea can also suggest whether a state has been neglecting the use of renewables over time as their source of energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Our Insights**\n",
        "Looking into the pie charts, there are 2 main contributors towards a state's energy consumption. Having coal as the main source of energy for 3 of the biggest states, NSW, VIC, and QLD with the range of 30-40% of total consumption in overall. Followed by gas which is over 50% of WA and NT total consumption. Knowing this, it seems that Australia is quite lacking in the aspect of renewables. Contributing towards close to 50% of Tasmania's total consumption, it is still rather lacking with the fact that it caters 10% or less on bigger states.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Limitation**\n",
        "Providing a microlevel perspective, this analysis fails to display any holistic perspective of the data. For instance, the periodic data of total consumption or the growth/decline rates of any relevant data. Nonetheless, even though this data may be futile in that aspect, it will be able to provide flawless *pinpoints* to analysts for their analysis."

        "##### **Data Analysis 2**\n",
        "##### **Analysis A**\n",
        "Focusing less on depth, the analysis provides a broad overview of the overall total energy consumption of each state per annum. This provides a macro level perspective over data analysis 1 if the analyst sought for periodic data of total energy consumption. The disparity in total energy consumption level of each state shows how inefficient it would be to display the analysis through line data as it would display many unnecessary big gaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering the size of the grouped chart, analysts can easily zoom into any one of the states to see their visual growth/decline over the 14 years. Each column is in contrasting colours, representing each year over the 14 years (2008-2022). The X-axis shows different clusters which represent each state in Australia. The Y-axis shows the total energy consumption level in Joule.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Our Insights**\n",
        "By looking at the graph, we can easily identify some fluctations and drops that occurs in various states in a macrolevel perspective. It is rather surprising to see the energy level if not steadily, harshly dropped on some of Australia's biggest states. Despite being the top contributors towards Australia's total consumption, NSW and Victoria seems to have taken some measures in regulating their usage. NSW has now levels QLD's total consumption, and Victoria is now right below Western Australia in energy consumption. Changes like this are rather necessary to watchover since this could also reflect each state's approach towards regulating consumptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Analysis B**\n",
        "The analysis highlights balance between depth and overall view of total consumption of a chosen state per annum. Displaying the chosen state's annual total energy consumption in a more in depth viewpoint as it shows the distribution of each fuel type contributing towards the chosen state's total energy consumption per year. Analysts could potentially spot when fluctuations of energy consumption occured and identify which fuel type(s) was consumed in contribution towards that occurence over the years 2008-2022.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "An area graph was utilised in response to potential analytical needs. The movement of the graph from left to right represents the timespan of the data (2008-2022). Each portion of the area divided by contrasting colours represents each fuel type. The bigger the portion means the more influence that fuel type has towards the chosen state's total energy consumption, vice versa. The X-axis represents each year within the 14 years timespan. The Y-axis represents the energy consumption of the chosen state in Joule.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Our Insights**\n",
        "Looking back at the previous analysis, we found that there was some changes that occured in some of the biggest states of Australia. In this next analysis, we can look deeper and see what caused these changes and predict some factors that could have contributed to these changes. Aside from the 2 states mentioned before, some other states tend to remain median on their consumption, yet some have been consuming more. Would this be a good or a bad thing? Well it is still impossible to hypothesise the exact factors, but if we look closer we can actually see a small, yet necessary change in each state.\n",
        "\n",
        "There was a growth in renewable usage by the start of 2020. Could this have been caused by a trend or a start of a new age? We need to look further.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Limitations**\n",
        "This analysis provides the most informative data overall, however it may not define Australia's standpoint in approaching their energy consumption regulations. The amount of total consumption per annum does not reflect whether a state has consumed too much or less energy overtime. There are other factors to be considered to evaluate this such as population and GSP. Analysts can refer to analysis 3 and 4 to evaluate this bit."

        "\n",
        "Similarly to analysis 2 and 4, this analysis empowers a balanced viewpoint on total energy consumption of Australian states. In contrast, it features the movement of total energy consumption per state based on proportions. It narrows the data further by factoring the annual total energy consumption data of each state per person. Taking into consideration individual consumption over time, analysts can identify points of fluctuations over the 14 years period in each Australian state or even hypothesise specific causes of the movement through a comparative analysis. In addition, by converting the total energy consumed into GigaJoule (GJ), analysts are enabled to visualise a more tangible output in their analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By utilising a multiple line chart instead of individual charts, we can both save time and power for the program to load the data. Analysts can also easily identify movement through the contrasting colours which represent each Australian state. Points aside, a line chart allows analysts to identify movements that occurred in between years by referring to the X-axis. The Y-axis easily represents the energy consumption level per capita in GigaJoule/person.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"*Line charts are best used when the key objective is to reveal continual variable associations prominently.*\" (Vira, 2024)\n",
        "\n",
        "The higher the line fluctuated means the more energy was consumed per person, vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Our Insights**\n",
        "In the previous analysis, we have akcnowledged that there were some surprising drop in energy consumption in 2 of Australia's biggest states and some others. Highlighting these big drops, we can now see some other potential factors through the movement in energy consumption per person. Evidently, both NSW and Victoria seem to have a decline in energy consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Highlighting on our previous analysis, the biggest drop in both total consumption and consumption per capita seems to be reflected upon Victoria's approach energy consumption. Moreover, both drop in NSW and Victoria's consumption per person even seems to have halved Western Australia which rather surprising. According to Australia's Bureau of Statistics (2021), the population of Victoria and NSW are both over thrice or even quadruple of Western Australia's growing consumption. Could this mean that Western Australia's approach to regulating consumption is rather loose? Considering WA being the biggest mining sector of Australia, would regulating more of its consumption affect Australia's entire GDP? We can then refer to Analysis 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, there is one movement which is rather surprising by simply looking at the most fluctuated line in the graph. Northern Territory according to our research and data provided previously, it is a state that has zero contribution towards Australia's entire coal energy type consumption. But, how is it very fluctuated, does that mean there is an increase in the population? Or is there perhaps a growth in the net income per person?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Limitation**\n",
        "This line chart completes data analysis as it provides a narrowed perspective on the total consumption of energy over time. However, it still does not fulfil the role of providing potential hypotheses towards Australia's approach towards regulating their energy consumption. It rather only shows the attitude of Australian residents towards energy consumption as data represents the consumption per person. Regulation could also be the potential factors, but there are other major factors that could influence this, such as net income or job opportunities. Hence, further analysis is required for policy analysts. We can refer to data analysis 4."

        "##### **Data Analysis 4**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Narrowing further than data analysis 2, a GSP-focused analysis eliminates the multiple assumptions suggested by the broad total energy consumption data. Movement on the graph is orchestrated based on the gross state product (GSP) of each state (in $million). In which, these are driven by net income of the population in each state. Population or size of a state would therefore be an irrelevant factor in this analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, this would be a 'cherry on top' for policy analysts when adding this on top of the consumption per capita data for their hypotheses through a concrete comparative analysis. For instance, a negative relationship between the movement in analysis 3 and 4 represents inefficiencies in energy consumption, regardless of factor. On the other hand, a positive relationship in both movements would mean that there is an economic or cultural factor involved, which eliminates any idea of inefficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to data analysis 3, the multiple line chart provides more depth in the analysis. In a periodical structure, best practice would be to use a line graph as it takes into consideration gradual and concurrent changes in between each data (Vira, 2024). X-axis represents the 14 year period which is reflected upon each line's movement. Each line are divided by contrasting colours representing each state in Australia. The Y-axis represents the level of energy consumption per unit of GSP in Gigajoule/million. The higher it is, the more energy is consumed per GSP, vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Our Insights**\n",
        "Analysis 3 acknowledges that Victoria and NSW has gone through a decline in consumption per person, but in fact it is also reflected upon their consumption per GSP. We can easily notice that there is a positive relationship between this and the movement in analysis 3. Could this mean that the decline was actually caused by the state's decline in their GSP? This could definitely be a contributing factor. A policy analyst could definitely see an opportunity for a implementation of renewable energy regulation in these states.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, another positive relationship that rather unsurprisingly existed in the visualisation is Northern Territory's consumption per GSP movement. Another easily noticeable positive relationship which practically proves the GSP and population growth factor theory. This definitely shows a big opportunity for policy analyst to test out big projects on renewable energy due to their growth in net income. Also, considering how Northern Territory is one of the smallest contributor towards Australia's renewable energy consumption, *NT could potentially become Australia's test subject* for its new consumption policy in response to the Paris Agreement goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the graph fails to show any relationship between WA's growth in consumption per capita and per gsp. The graph rather shows a consistently low GSP per consumption in Australia with only close to half to twice more than NSW and Victoria's declining consumption. This definitely reflects an inefficient use of energy in Western Australia since its per capita usage does not reflect on its GSP. This will definitely be an important topic of consumption control for the government on their regulations to achieve their energy consumption goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Limitation**\n",
        "This analysis is the last piece of the entire analysis puzzle for every analyst to hypothesise Australia's approach into regulating their energy consumption. However, it does not have the capability of acknowledging external data and factors such as a secondary data of containing another country or international influences. It would definitely be irrelevant to the requirements for this project, but it could definitely be an addition to be considered to develop this analysis further."

        "\n",
        "* **Security:** Leaving the database continuously opened without closing is like leaving the doors unlocked after leaving a house. Regardless how limited the access is, if it is out in the open, any highly-skilled individuals can easily alter/steal information stored in the database.\n",
        "* **Traffic:** Try driving in an intersection with all lanes having green lights non-stop. Either it is being eager for an accident to happen or traffic to come and halt the entire flow.\n",

Without closing, any new data/information added will go to that particular database without the user's knowledge, altering the existing database in the process.\n",
        "* **Performance:** Having the database to continually be open also means having the computer constantly calculate information that is also inside the database. As a result, a portion of the available RAM is taken away, reducing the computer's performance.\n",
